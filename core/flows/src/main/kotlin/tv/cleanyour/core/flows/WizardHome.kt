// 0.4.6: the safety net under R0 (HomeSwitchRisk.wizardStaysOnSafely), for every TV. The switch may
// leave a setup wizard on when it claims no Home; should the wizard become a Home claimant later
// (a TV update, a firmware that turns it back on), it could take Home while the TV's own home
// screen is off, the RecoveryActivity risk of upstream #506 and #422. So each time Manage connects,
// it reads the TV's Home again, and when ours is Home, the TV's own home screen is off (no claimant)
// and a setup wizard is now a claimant, Manage says so and offers the way back: "Use the TV's own
// home screen" (PlanRequest.UseStockHome), the existing undo of the switch, which switches nothing
// else on (no accessibility, no Wi-Fi).

// 0.4.7 (xgimi-mogo-3-pro, which 0.4.6 switches; upstream TROUBLESHOOTING "Google TV comes back after a few remote

// buttons, its programmable and profile buttons and power send F keys to com.xgimi.xrmservice's
// XgimiGlobalKeyBroadcast, which runs `pm enable` on launcherx, and Google TV takes Home back. So each time Manage
// connects it also asks whether the TV's own home screen, which this app switched off (its last record of that
// package is our Disable), claims Home again; the card says so (TvCard.stockHomeBack) and the log has a line.
// Nothing is switched here: the Home button helper is the fix for such TVs.
