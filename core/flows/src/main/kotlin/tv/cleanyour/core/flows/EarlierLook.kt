// look2 (spec 1, review B1): one step of history per TV. Every send that changes the look keeps
// the choice the TV had before it in tvs/<id>/earlier.txt (HomePrefs form), and, when that look
// showed the person's photo, the photo in tvs/<id>/earlier.jpg (at most OwnPicture.MAX_BYTES). The
// first send keeps the TV's look before it: Setup's Default look. "Put back the earlier look" only
// fills the draft (LookEdit.PutBackEarlier); the one button sends it. Like picture.jpg, both files
// live in the app's private files under the TV's folder: never backed up, never in a TV report or a
// restore point, gone with "Forget this TV".
