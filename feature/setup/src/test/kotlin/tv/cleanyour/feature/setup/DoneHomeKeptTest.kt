// QA of 0.4.5 (bug-040-retry): the home check ran out of time, the TV's own home screen went back,
// and Done said only "Your TV is ready" and a count. It now says the TV's own home screen is back
// and why. 0.4.7 (HomeKept): a TV that keeps its own home screen by Setup's decision leads with
// the outcome, offers no card to add, and its restart line says the home screen is the TV's own.
